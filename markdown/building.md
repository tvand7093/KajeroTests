### Building
Open the command line and navigate to the cloned folder. Run `make` and all of the project will build.
The results will go into a newly created `bin` directory. From there, just run the program you want.
For example, to run the frontend parser, just run `./princess`.

### Running Tests
To run the tests, call `make tests` and it will build/run all the unit tests in the tests folder.
