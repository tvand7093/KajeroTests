### Generating html
To generate the html and run the node application, add markdown files in the markdown folder and run the following code.

```bash
npm start
```

The generated documents will be placed in a generated folder,
with the name of the markdown file used as the name of the generated html document.
Afterwards, the node website will start.

This will run the node server locally on port 3000, and the site can be viewed by navigating
to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000).
